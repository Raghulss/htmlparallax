      <h2>WHO IS TONY STARK</h2>
      <p>
        Anthony Edward Tony Stark was born on May 29,1970 in New York to Howard Stark and Maria Stark. He is a New York socialite
        and a philanthropist. In late 2000s, Stark was captured by a terrorist group in Afghanistan where he and his cellmate Yinsen
        secretly build a suit of powerful armor with a small arc reactor. Tony escapes but sadly Yinsen dies. Tony stops weapon production
        in his Stark Industries and secretly buils a more sleek and stylish suit with the help of an even powerful arc reactor, thus making
        himself as the 'IRONMAN'.

      <h2>BECOMING IRONMAN</h2>
      <p>
        Stark comes to know that his co-worker Stane is responsible for his captivity and illegal arms traffiking. On a fight between Stane
         and Stark, Stark's Ironman defeats Stane's armor suit. The next day Stark publicly admits that he is "Ironman".Stark has become a superstar and uses his Iron Man suit
         for peaceful means, resisting government pressure to sell his designs. He reinstitutes the Stark Expo to continue his father's legacy, but discovers
         that the palladium core in the arc reactor that keeps Stark alive and powers the armor is slowly poisoning him. Growing increasingly reckless and despondent about his
         impending death, he appoints Pepper Potts CEO of Stark Industries.
         Stark competes in the Monaco Historic Grand Prix and is attacked mid-race by Ivan Vanko. Stark discovers a hidden message from his father, a diagram of the structure of a new element, which Stark synthesizes.
         Stark and Rhodes together defeat Vanko and his drones.
